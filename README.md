# Accounts Card

## Pain

I have a lot of accounts, LinkedIn, Twitter, Github and so on. Companies ask for my LinkedIn and Github. Friends ask for my Twitter and Instagram. When I want to share one of these accounts, I have to go to the specific site, find the URL and copy & paste it.

## Solution

I would like to have a shareable digital contact card I can send to people. It has only links to accounts, no unnecessary information. And it is customizable to the recipient.

## Unique Selling Point

The USP is the feature to create custom cards, e.g. one card shows the links to LinkedIn and Github (for a company), another card shows the links to Twitter and Instagram (for a friend). Both, the company and the friend, can only see the links I want them to see.

## MVP

1. I copy all my account links into the app.
2. I can create customized shareable cards, that only show the account links I want the recipient to see.

## Validation

There are some apps for digital business cards. They seem to be crammed with a lot of information. There is also [@Booligoosh's](https://twitter.com/Booligoosh) maker.rock, that speaks to a specific audience and doesn't have the customization feature.

## Monetization

Max limit of accounts to show on a card. Add custom accounts for specific sites. Subscribe to store your accounts, so you don't have to input your accounts all the time.
